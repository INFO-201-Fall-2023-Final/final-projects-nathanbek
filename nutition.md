Alerts by Categories 

Inaccurate Prediction: 1 

Potential Issue: The method used to categorize depression severity may lead to inaccurate predictions. 

Mitigation: Validate and refine the prediction model to improve accuracy.  

Completeness: 1 

Potential Issue: Incomplete data for some entities or years. 

Mitigation: Use imputation techniques or acknowledge gaps in analysis. 

Provenance: 1 

Potential Issue: Limited information on the origin and handling of the data. 

Mitigation: Provide detailed documentation on data provenance and cleaning process. 

Socioeconomic Bias: 1 

Potential Issue: Dataset may exhibit bias in socioeconomic representation. 

Mitigation: Acknowledge the bias and provide context in analysis.
